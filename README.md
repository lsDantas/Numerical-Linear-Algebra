# Numerical Linear Algebra

Code for a university numerical linear algebra class. These algorithms were implemented in Scilab and are available under the MIT License (2020).

## Structure 
The algorithms are organized as follows:

* `linear-systems`: Algorithms for solving systems of linear equations.
* `eigenvalue`: Numerical algorithms for calculating eigenvalues along with their corresponding eigenvectors.
* `qr-decomp`: QR and QR-like matrix decomposition algorithms.
* `svd`: Image compression using singular value decomposition.

Files are arranged according to theme. Their dependencies might be contained in a different directory. 

The code in the SVD folder requires the Scilab Image Processing and Computer Vision Toolbox (IPCV) module in order to run.
